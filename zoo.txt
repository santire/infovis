society is poducing digital information at an astonishing rate
1,200 exabytes
meaningfully
explore
visual representatios may also help engage more diverse audiences in exploration and analysis
visual encodings
spatial position leads to the most accurate decoding of numerical data
exotic
interactive
Time-series
With some forms of time-series data, raw values are less important than relative changes
normalized
Other forms of time-series data may be better seen in aggregate
stacked graph
Stacked graphs do not support negative numbers and are meaningless for data that should not be summed
small multiples
accurately see both overall trends and seasonal patterns
Horizon graphs
increasing the data density of a time-series
exploratory data analysis
gaining insight into how data are distributed to inform data transformation and modeling decisions
histograms
box-and-whisker
stem-and-leaf plot
minimalistic representation
quantile-quantile (or Q-Q) plots
obvious limitation of Q-Q plots is that their effective use requires that viewers possess some statistical know-how
Multivariate data occurs very frequently and is notoriously hard to represent
small multiples of scatter plots showing a set of pairwise relations among variables
scatter plot matrix
Parallel coordinates
maps
cartographic projection
flow map
movement of a quantiy in space and (implicitly) in time
Choropleth Maps
aggregated by geograhical areas
graduated symbol map
Cartograms
area directly encodes a data variable
Hierarchies
Node-Link Diagrams
dendrogram
cluster
polar rather than Crtesian coordinates has a pleasing aeshetica
Adjacency diagrams
space-filling variants of node-link diagrams
Enclosure diagrams
space-filling, using containment rather than adjacency to represent the hierarchy
"graph" to describe a network
arc diagram
adjacency matrix
